# SafeWasm

**SafeWasm** is a formal verification framework for **WebAssembly (WASM)** programs.  
It translates **WAT (WebAssembly Text Format)** into **Boogie**, enabling automated reasoning with **SMT solving (Z3)** and **bounded model checking (Corral)**, built on the modern **.NET 9.0** platform.

## 🧩 Origin & Motivation

The project originates from the formal verification concepts explored in **Microsoft VeriSol**,  
which translated Solidity smart contracts into Boogie for verification.  
However, **SafeWasm** redefines the vision: instead of focusing on one programming language,  
it uses **WebAssembly (WASM)** as a *universal intermediate representation (IR)* for formal verification.

WebAssembly’s stack-based and deterministic nature makes it ideal for certifiable reasoning,  
allowing verification of programs compiled from various source languages (Rust, C, Go, etc.)  
and across different execution environments — not only blockchains.

## 🌍 Why WebAssembly?

WebAssembly (WASM) provides several properties that make it particularly suitable for formal verification:

- **Portability:** universal compilation target (Rust, C, C++, Go, etc.)  
- **Determinism:** well-defined execution semantics  
- **Safety:** sandboxed linear memory model  
- **Verifiability:** simple, stack-based operational semantics  
- **Adoption:** widely used in blockchain, embedded, and critical systems  

Together, these features make WASM an excellent foundation for scalable and provable verification frameworks.

SafeWasm translates WAT programs into **Boogie**.  
Verification is performed in two complementary ways:

1. **Boogie + Z3 (SMT-based deductive verification)** to prove properties by discharging verification conditions (VCs).  
2. If Z3 cannot prove a property (e.g., timeout/unknown), **Corral (BMC)** is used to search for a concrete counterexample trace.
